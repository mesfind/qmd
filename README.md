## Why Read Material

Scientific reports gain full credibility through reproducibility. Readers must access the complete computational environment—data, code, and analysis—to verify results.

Quarto combines code, text, and figures in one file, producing publication-quality reports. Share a Quarto document with datasets, and anyone with a computer can reproduce your epidemiological models, risk maps, or surveillance dashboards exactly.
