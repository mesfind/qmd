# Alternative Outputs and Extensions

This book itself is authored entirely in Quarto—demonstrating its power for reproducible scientific documents. One of Quarto's strengths is the low barrier to switching output formats. Most changes involve updating your `_quarto.yml` file to specify the target (e.g., book, website, or slideshow), allowing you to focus on content and code rather than reformatting.

## Core Output Formats

Quarto supports diverse formats for sharing research:

- [Books](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) – Multi-chapter documents like this one.

## Manuscripts and Journals

[Quarto Manuscripts](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/) bundle source files, code, and outputs for journal submission—ideal for reproducible epidemiology papers. Future updates to this book will cover their use in detail.
