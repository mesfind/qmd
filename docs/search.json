This might appear to be a “current” problem, but it has indeed been a problem throughout a lot of scientific history. To illustrate this, here’s a nice article by Rich FitzJohn, Reproducible research is still a challenge, which was written 10 years ago, in 2014, and provides a list of the challenges and lessons learned in making research reproducible. The list is still relevant. This problem isn’t completely solved. But, we can make it easier to solve, to get further.\nReproducibility isn’t just something that impacts a few people, and it’s not cheap. A 2010 estimate stated that in the biomedical industry, in the USA, irreproducibility (not being able to reproduce a given piece of work) costs $28 Billion dollars annually 1. That was one country, one field, and one year.\nSo what can we do about it?",

This is an idea from Donald Knuth where you combine your text with your code output to create a document. This is a blend of your literature (text), and your programming (code), to create something that you can read from top to bottom. Imagine your paper - the introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion, and all the bits of code that make each section. With Quarto, you can see all the pieces of your data analysis all together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSome history: Quarto, Rmarkdown, Sweave\n\n\n\n\n\nLiterate programming was a popular idea, and it has had some interesting discussion and contributions over the years. Notably, in the R ecosystem, the Sweave, (The S language + weaving together text and code) program provided a way to write text and code together. As with any technology, there were some speedbumps with using Sweave, and some of the reasons we are not teaching it now is because:\n\nIt uses a form of LaTeX, which provides great flexibility at the cost of complexity.\nPrinting figures involves additional work\nThere isn’t a way to save (cache) your work. Every analysis has to be repeated from start to finish. This was time consuming.",

    "text": "4.4 What is RStudio, and why should I use it?\n\nIf R is the engine and bare bones of your car, then RStudio is like the rest of the car.\n\nThe engine is super critical part of your car. But in order to make things properly functional, you need to have a steering wheel, comfy seats, a radio, rear and side view mirrors, storage, and seatbelts. RStudio is all those niceties\nThe RStudio layout has the following features:\n\nOn the upper left, the Quarto script\nOn the lower left, the R console\nOn the lower right, the view for files, plots, packages, help, and viewer.\nOn the upper right, the environment / history pane\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the RStudio working environment.\n\n\n\n\nWe saw a bit of what an Quarto script does.\n\nThe R console is the bit where you can run your code.\nThe file/plot/package viewer is a handy browser for your current files, like Finder, or File Explorer.\nPlots are where your plots appear, you can view packages, see the help files.\nThe environment / history pane contains the list of things you have created, and the past commands that you have run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteYour Turn: RStudio default options\n\n\n\nTo first get set up, I highly recommend changing the following setting\nTools &gt; Global Options (or Cmd + , on macOS)\nUnder the General tab:\n\nFor workspace:\n\nUncheck restore .RData into workspace at startup.\nSave workspace to .RData on exit : “Never”.\n\nFor History:\n\nUncheck “Always save history (even when not saving .RData).\nUncheck “Remove duplicate entries in history”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Setting the options right for RStudio, so you don’t restore previous sessions work, and don’t save it either.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that you won’t save the objects and other things that you create in your R session and reload them. This is important for two reasons\n\nReproducibility: you don’t want to have objects from last week cluttering your session\nPrivacy: you don’t want to save private data or other things to your session. You only want to read these in.\n\nYour “history” is the commands that you have entered into R.\nAdditionally, not saving your history means that you won’t be relying on things that you typed in the last session, which is a good habit to get into!",

It is a problem because, among other things, using setwd() like this:\n\nHas 0% chance of working on someone else’s machine (this could include you in 6 months!)\nYour file is not self-contained and portable.

    "text": "5.5 What is a file path?\nThis might all be a bit confusing if you don’t know what a file path is. A file path is the machine-readable directions to where files on your computer live. So, the file path:\n/Users/njtierney/Desktop/qmd4sci-materials/demo.R\nDescribes the location of the file “demo.R”. This could be visualised as:\nusers\n  └── njtierney\n      └── Desktop\n          └──  qmd4sci-materials\n               └── demo.R &lt;&lt; THIS IS THE FILE HERE\n               └── exercises\n               └── exploratory-data-analysis\n                   └── eda-document.qmd\n                   └── eda-script.R\n               └──  data\n                    └──  gapminder.csv\nSo, if you want to read in the gapminder.csv file, you might need to write code like this:\ngapminder &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/njtierney/Desktop/qmd4sci-materials/data/gapminder.csv\")\nAs we now know, this is a problem, because this is not portable code. It is unlikely someone else will have the gapminder.csv data stored under the folders, \"Users/njtierney/Desktop\".\nIf you have an RStudio project file inside the qmd4sci-materials folder, you can instead write the following:\ngapminder &lt;- read_csv(\"data/gapminder.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteYour Turn\n\n\n\n\n(1-2 minutes) Imagine you see the following directory path: \"/Users/miles/etc1010/week1/data/health.csv\" what are the folders above the file, health.csv?\nWhat would be the result of using the following code in demo-gapminder.qmd, and then using the code, and then moving this to another location, say inside your C drive?\n\nsetwd(\"Downloads/etc1010/week1/week1.qmd)",

    "text": "5.6 Is there an answer to the madness?\nThis file path situation is a real pain. Is there an answer to the madness?\nThe answer is yes!\nI highly recommend when you start on a new idea, new research project, paper. Anything that is new. It should start its life as an rstudio project.\nAn rstudio project helps keep related work together in the same place. Amongst other things, they:\n\nKeep all your files together.\nSet the working directory to the project directory.\nStarts a new session of R.\nRestore previously edited files into the editor tabs.\nRestore other rstudio settings.\nAllow for multiple R projects open at the same time.\n\nThis helps keep you sane, because:\n\nYour projects are each independent.\nYou can work on different projects at the same time.\nObjects and functions you create and run from project idea won’t impact one another.\n\nYou can refer to your data and other projects in a consistent way.\n\nAnd finally, the big one:\nRStudio projects help resolve file path problems, because they automatically set the working directory to the location of the rstudio project.\nLet’s open one together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteYour Turn Use your own rstudio project\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, and run the following code to start a new rstudio project called “qmd4sci-materials”.\n\nusethis::use_course(\"njtierney/qmd4sci-materials\")\n\nFollow the prompts to download this to your desktop and then run the rstudio project. (You can move it later if you like!)\nYou are now in an rstudio project!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteYour Turn: open the demo.R file\n\n\n\n\nRun the code inside the demo.R file\nWhy does the read_csv code work?\nRun the code inside the exploratory-data-analysis folder - eda-script.R.\nDoes the read_csv code work?\nRun the code inside the exploratory-data-analysis folder - eda-document.qmd, by clicking the “render” button (we’ll go into this in more detail soon!)\nDoes it work?",

You want to think about:\n\nKeeping it short.\nNo spaces.\nCombining words.\n\nFor example, I had a project looking at bat calls, so I called it screech, because bats make a screech-y noise. But maybe you’re doing some global health analysis so you call it “world-health”.\nAnd click “create project”.",
